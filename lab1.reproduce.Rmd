# Linear regression

## Assumptions

Standard analysis of linear regression is based on the following *four assumptions*:

1. Linear relation with fixed regressors

2. Independence 

3. Constant variance 

4. Mean zero error 

These assumptions can be succinctly written as: $Y_i = X_i^T\beta + \epsilon_i$, $\epsilon_i \sim^{iid} D(0,\sigma^2)$.

## Example

Using `mtcars` dataset, we fit a linear regression in `R`.

```{r}
out = lm(mpg ~ disp + wt, data = mtcars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(out)$coef, digits=2, caption="Regression table")
```

The variable `wt` has statistically significant association with `mpg`.

Next, we present the residual plot. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(out, which=1)
```
